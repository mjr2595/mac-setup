# Add to Babylist

We're registered for our upcoming baby at [Babylist](https://www.babylist.com/). They have either a Chrome extension or a bookmarklet to add items from sites BUT I didn't want to install the extension and the bookmarlet wasn't working with Brave browser for whatever reason... Oh and there's no way to just manually add a link from the portal?? _ugh_

So I whipped up this lil script for use with Raycast. Basically a bash script version of the bookmarklet. It encodes the URL and title then opens it in the broswer, which will add the item to your registry.

Is it overkill and unnecessary? Absolutely. But it works!
