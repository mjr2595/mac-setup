# My Mac Setup

This repo contains info on all the apps, tools, and settings I use on my Mac

## Themes

I switch up themes pretty often. Sometimes just based on mood or the season...
But it's usually between

- [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/)
- [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)
- Atom One Dark

Slack themes can be found in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mjr2595/fa63d054ea08bff1fdd848c355fe89df)
