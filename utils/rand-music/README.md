# Random Music Picker

I get way too distracted searching for music on youtube... I use a nifty pomo app called [tomatillo timer](https://timer.flotes.app/) for listening to music while trying to be productive. BUT I'll catch myself getting bored of the music after a few sessions and then going to youtube to get a new music link and well ya know -- I get sucked in and distracted.

So I saved some of my favorite videos in a [markdown file](../../apps/Sync/Browser/Pomo/music-favs.md). This lil raycast script just grabs a yt video ID from that list at random and copies to the clipboard.

Tomatillo Timer does has similiar functionality but only if you pay and I'm cheap.
