# My Mac Setup

This repo contains info on all the apps, tools, and settings I use on my Mac

### Config Files

Config files are organized by application and managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). See the [configs](./configs/) readme for more deets.

### Homebrew

I use Homebrew to keep packages and apps updated and installed on my computer. I typically keep two Brewfiles -- one for personal use and one for work. See [apps](./apps/) for that stuff.

### Utilities

I also have some helpful scripts n things in this repo. Most of these I integrate with Raycast via Script Commands. For more details, see the [utils](./utils/) directory.

### Themes

I switch up themes pretty often to help spice things up. Sometimes just based on mood or the season...
